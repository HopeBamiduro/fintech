i am trying to get my hands dirty.
i must learn git by fire by force
i wont give up
i am surly going to get there
the devil is a liar
i am more than a conqueror
the lord is the strength of my salvationwhom shall i fear

this would return the file to the last commited status
jpversace is a good tutor
yussuf and i are olodo
it is me that is the biggest olodo.
not you and Yusuf
let me add more lines
