i want to move this file directly into the staging index 
i would not be going through the process one afte the other
i would be moving the changes in my tracked file directly into my repository
so i would just use the -am command for git commit to do this.
the next step is to make use of git restore without adding and commiting the changes made
this would return the file to the last commited status
